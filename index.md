# Music player control

I build this simple software to call the OS Keyboard event `VK_MEDIA_NEXT_TRACK` from my keyboard to go to the next music (who doesn't have a specific key to do this).

I have an Logitech K270 (at the time) who doesn't have a specific key for advance the sound track. But, they have a software that allow to configure some key functions.
Before I can only increase, decrease and play/pause buttons. Now I change the "home" button to go to the next sound.

So, this software can be atached to the logitech setPoint to call the this functions: NEXT, PREVIOUS, etc...


# How to use

```bash
# Default, go to next music
C:\(...)\ControleFaixasMuscais.exe

# Explicit call to next music
C:\(...)\ControleFaixasMuscais.exe NEXT

# Call to previous music
C:\(...)\ControleFaixasMuscais.exe PREVIOUS

# Call to Play or Pause
C:\(...)\ControleFaixasMuscais.exe PLAY_PAUSE
```
